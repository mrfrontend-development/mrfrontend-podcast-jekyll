<p><i>This is not the transcribed version of the podcast, but a summary of what I talked about in the podcast!</i></p>

<p>This week I was listening to a podcast¬†<a href="https://soundcloud.com/starthere-webdev/learn-a-framework-not-a-language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Start here Web Development - Learn a Framework not a Language</a>.</p>

<p>At the start, his idea was making me a little bit angry, because in my opinion developers should learn Vanilla JavaScript before working with a JavaScript Framework.</p>

<p>Learning Vanilla JavaScript first then a JavaScript framework has some advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<h2><b>Pros &amp; Cons for learning Vanilla JavaScript first</b></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Learning Vanilla JavaScript will give you the feeling of going slowly.</li>
 	<li>‚ÄúHello World‚Äù examples are boring!</li>
 	<li>After a while, it will give you a strong knowledge base</li>
 	<li>Helps you fix bugs more easy and faster</li>
 	<li>When you have more experience, it will make you more flexible in the choice of a JavaScript Framework</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Pros &amp; Cons for learning JavaScript by a Framework¬†</b></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Frameworks make the development easier</li>
 	<li>Will give you a jump start</li>
 	<li>If there is a bug, you gonna have a hard time fixing.</li>
 	<li>Are well tested across browsers</li>
 	<li>Won‚Äôt force you to learn the basics of Vanilla JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, both lists could go on and on.</p>

<p>I prefer learning Vanilla JavaScript first, that is because of my own experience with not knowing JavaScript. <a href="https://blog.mrfrontend.org/2016/02/the-starting-story-of-mr-frontend-nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I got refused a lot when searching a new job</a>!</p>

<p>But in the end, everyone is a different learner! I like to learn from video‚Äôs, you like to learn from books and someone else likes to learn differently. But that‚Äôs not wrong!</p>

<p>We are all different types of people. But learning is the best skill you can have as a Developer! So it‚Äôs pretty important to know your way of learning!</p>

<p>You should empower the way you like to learn, it will make you more happy and motivated. If your friend likes to learn from books, let him/her do that. Do you like to watch coding video‚Äôs on Youtube? Stick with it! Know your way of learning the best!</p>
<h2><b>My 3 tips for deciding how to learn JavaScript</b></h2>
<h3><b>Tip 1</b></h3>
<p>Pick the way you like to learn!</p>

<p>Try different things before you decide. There is no right or wrong! There is only your way of doing it. After a while, you will discover what works for you!</p>
<h3><b>Tip 2</b></h3>
<p>When your hitting a knowledge wall or can‚Äôt figure out a bug, ask for HELP!</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt wait a week or month to fix your issue! Just ask for help!</p>
<h3><b>Tip 3</b></h3>
<p>Find a developer that wants to help you, guide you or mentor you!</p>

<p>(<i>Btw, that is where Mr Frontend is all about. Helping you to learn Frontend Development more effectively with help!</i>)</p>
<h2><b>Question!</b></h2>
<p>My question for you to answer in the comments, how do you like to learn JavaScript? The Vanilla way or the Framework way? What did it bring you?</p>

<p>Share your story with me! And if you need any help, please let me know üòä</p>
